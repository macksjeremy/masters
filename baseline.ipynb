      "Always YTA on these wedding posts where you expect people to drop so much money on YOU. Who cares if she has tattoos, it's her money! For my 'bachelorette\" I had my friends over for dinner?! We got married in a small wedding (30 people) abroad as my partner and i are from different countries, and made it very clear that we did not expect people to attend OR buy gifts. The ones who wanted to came, the ones who couldn't, didn't. No hard feelings about it either. We also paid for the accommodation for around half the wedding party who we knew it would be a struggle for. We paid for all the food and booze and entertainment. I had no bridesmaids dresses, nothing compulsory whatsoever. Just an awesome, memorable day. This wedding culture is getting so out of control. always yta on these wedding posts where you expect people to drop so much money on you. who cares if she has tattoos, it's her money! for my 'bachelorette\" i had my friends over for dinner?! we got married in a small wedding (30 people) abroad as my partner and i are from different countries, and made it very clear that we did not expect people to attend or buy gifts. the ones who wanted to came, the ones who couldn't, didn't. no hard feelings about it either. we also paid for the accommodation for around half the wedding party who we knew it would be a struggle for. we paid for all the food and booze and entertainment. i had no bridesmaids dresses, nothing compulsory whatsoever. just an awesome, memorable day. this wedding culture is getting so out of control.\n",

The arrest endangers the rendezvous with the plane. \n",

      "At the airport, Renault shows up to arrest Laszlo, but Blaine holds him at gunpoint. The ruse was always to get Renault to release Laszlo so Blaine could help Lazlo escape, but more importantly, for Ilsa to go with Laszlo, not stay in Casablanca. However, Major Strasser, the local Nazi commander, then steps out of the shadows to hold Blaine at gunpoint, ready to kill or arrest Laszlo.\n",

The Fall and Joy Division are often credited with making post-punk popular, but I would say that post-hardcore was really the genre that the latter two formed around.

I like to entertain myself that we live in a quantum like solipsism, one were all my interactions is reflected on me individually in Everett's multiverse, and the same is for everyone else. All possible version exists, and they would mean that I'm the largest influencer in my world of experience, and so are you in yours, but in the end we're also interconnected, and we are all moving different ways in the world of infinite possibilities, and we will surely end up in different places. The version of you that I meet is the one who ended up in my timeline that reflects my previous actions, and the version of me that ends up in your timeline reflects your previous actions, and there's a version of both of us to match all possible previous actions. solipsism is a valid hypothesis, but not a fruitful one. i like to entertain myself that we live in a quantum like solipsism, one were all my interactions is reflected on me individually in everett's multiverse, and the same is for everyone else. all possible version exists, and they would mean that i'm the largest influencer in my world of experience, and so are you in yours, but in the end we're also interconnected, and we are all moving different ways in the world of infinite possibilities, and we will surely end up in different places. the version of you that i meet is the one who ended up in my timeline that reflects my previous actions, and the version of me that ends up in your timeline reflects your previous actions, and there's a version of both of us to match all possible previous actions.\n",
